# MyLexer
The aim is to develop a custom lexer generator like Flex that takes in a input program, which is a set of rules defining the lexical tokens and input characters from another input program defined by the user. MyLexer will then take those tokens and character pairs and generate a Lexical Analyzer for those specified rules.
